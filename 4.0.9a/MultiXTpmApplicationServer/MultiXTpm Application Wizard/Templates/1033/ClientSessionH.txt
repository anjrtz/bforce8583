/*!
	When a new connection is created, the connected C[!output PROJECT_NAME_NB]ServerLink or	C[!output PROJECT_NAME_NB]ClientLink object 
	creates an instance	of this class and the two objects become associated. we use this object in order to save state
	and context between calls from the remote partner to the host. In MultiXTpm based system, sessions are 
	statefull objects and a session is a system wide object, this means that if a message from one session is sent
	to the MultiXTpm process, and MultiXTpm elected a specific process to handle the request in a specific
	session, all other messages that are supported by the server process , having the same session id of the original message,
	are	forwarded to the first process elected and to the same session object on the server process.
	this enables the server process to save context between calls and for example to keep database connection
	opened for the whole duration of the session whithout the need to close and reopen the connection
	for each call to the server.

	So the main functionality of the class is an endless loop of:
	-	Receive a message from the associated link
	-	Forward the message to MultiXTpm
	-	Wait for a response from the server process
	-	Forward the response to the associated link
	-	Wait for an indication from the link on the completion of the send operation to the remote partner
	- Notify the server process about the completion of it's response and optionaly forward a new message.
	- Wait for a new message from the associated link
