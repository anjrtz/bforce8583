						<strong>MultiXTpm ISO 8583 Server</strong> is an application built on top <a href="MultiXTpm Application Server.htm">MultiXTpm Application Server</a>. Its purpose is to provide a starting point for developing server applications that are required to handle <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/StandardsQueryFormHandler.StandardsQueryFormHandler?languageCode=en&isoNumber=8583">ISO 8583</a> based messages and transactions. This prototype application is developped to satisfy most of the requirements published by the <a href="http://www.berlin-group.org/">THE Berlin GROUP</a> in the document <a href="http://www.berlin-group.org/documents/BG_Authorisation_1.pdf">Bilateral and Multilateral Processing of International Transactions in Europe - ISO 8583 Interchange Messages</a>. This application includes the following features:<br />
						<ul>
							<li>ISO 8583 Message Parser:<ul>
								<li>ISO 8583-1-1987 Messages parsing and creation. </li>
								<li>ISO 8583-2-1993 Messages parsing and creation.</li>
							</ul></li>
							
							<li>Act as an Issuer Gateway - provide gateway capablities for accepting Authorization/Reversal requests and forwarding the requests to internal resources for processing.</li>
							<li>Act as Acquirer Gateway - provide the capabilities for forwarding requests to remote Issuer Gateways and then reply with the response to original sender of the request, which could be a POS terminal or another Acquirer Gateway in the chain.</li>
							<li>Act as an Authorization Server - provide the functionality to validate messages contents and format. It has all service routines to handle Authorization Messages (MTI 1100), Reversal Messages (MTI 142x) and Network Management Messages (MTI 1804, Sign In, Sign Off and Echo Test). These service routine do not include the actual Card Processing since it is implementation dependent.</li>
							<li>Includes an ISO 8583 Test client that reads XML based transactions and sends them
								to the server after converting them to ISO 8583 messages.&nbsp;</li>
							<li>Support for TCP/IP channel with 2 bytes header indicating the actual message size. Other channels and framing protocols (such as X28) can easily be implemented.</li>
							<li>Support for SOAP/XML Web Services interface. This enables any client that can
								act as a Web Services client to send to the server XML based messages without using
								the ISO 8583 format on the client side.</li>
							<li>Support listenning on multiple TCP/IP port when acting as an Issuer Gateway or an Authorization Server.</li>
							<li>Support multiple connections to remote Issuer Gateways.</li>
							<li>Support multiple Gateway IDs when communicating with Remote Gateways where each connection can have it's unique Gateway ID. This enables the server to act as a proxy for other gateways.</li>

								Web Services client software. </li>
							<li><strong>ISO 8583 Back End</strong> and/or <strong>ISO 8583 Authorizer</strong> – The Business Logic handler. Acts locally on POS terminals requests or forwards requests to the next Issuer Gateway in the chain.</li>
							<li><strong>ISO 8583 Acquirer Gateway FE</strong> – Connection initiator and communications handler. Handles all data transfers to remote Issuer Gateways.</li>

							ISO 8583 Issuer Gateway FE</h2>
						This process acts as a Listener/Transport handler. It is responsible for the actual communication with POS terminals or Remote Acquirer Gateways. This process always acts as Listener, it never initiates calls. When a new connection is established, it creates a new session object, it waits for incoming <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/StandardsQueryFormHandler.StandardsQueryFormHandler?languageCode=en&isoNumber=8583">ISO 8583</a> messages and when a full message is received, it is forwarded to <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm" title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm</a> process (in the context of the session created earlier) with a special indication of the MTI received. <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm" title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm</a> in turn forwards the request to the appropriate <strong>ISO 8583 Back End</strong>
						or <strong>ISO 8583 Authorizer</strong> process for the actual processing of the request. When a response comes from the 
						
						<strong>ISO 8583 Back End</strong> or
						<strong>ISO 8583 Authorizer</strong> process, it is forwarded back to the originator of the request. The connection is kept open, waiting for the next request, or disconnect from the client or an idle timer expires in which case the connection is aborted. This process is multithreaded and all communication activities are in NOWAIT manner, so it does not block on any call, so it can theoretically process unlimited number of connections simultaneously. This process can have more then one instance where each instance can manage a different range of ports. All instances can run on a single machine or can be divided between multiple machines.

						This process has the same functionality as <strong>ISO 8583 Issuer Gatewy FE</strong>

						When it receives a call (may contain multiple requests), it translates the <strong>
							SOAP/XML</strong> data to <strong>ISO 8583 Message</strong> and it forwards it

When it starts, it receives from <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm" title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm</a> a list of addresses and ports and IDs of Remote Issuer Gateways and tries to connect to each one of them in order to establish a permanent connection.

From that point on, it receives requests from <strong>ISO 8583 Back End</strong> or <strong>ISO 8583 Authorizer</strong> processes, forwards them to the appropriate Issuer Gateway and when the response arrives, it forwards it back to the approriate <strong>ISO 8583 Back End</strong>
						or <strong>ISO 8583 Authorizer</strong>. This process forwards the requests as soon as it receives them, it does not wait for responses before forwarding the next requests.
