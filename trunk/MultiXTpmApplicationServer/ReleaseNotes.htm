						MultiXTpm Application Server Projects</h2>
						MultiXTpm Application Server solution contains the following projects:<br />
						<ul>
							<li>MultiX - This project builds the base DLL that enables all inter process communication, session management, communication handling, timers, queues etc. Some of the header files in the “include” directory under <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">
									MultiXTpm Application Server</span></strong> directory, contain documentation that can be produced using Doxygen. Every process that is incorporated in the Application Server environment, needs to link to the MultiX DLL.</li>
							<li>MultiXTpm - MultiXTpm is the actual Application Server, queues manager and load balancer. As mentioned before, it links to the MultiX DLL. Almost all traffic in the system pass thru MultiXTpm (except when sending messages between processes that share the same session). MultiXTpm is responsible for starting and stopping all processes that are part of the Application Server. It monitors the state of the processes and if finds out that a process has terminated for no reason, it will restart it. MultiXTpm reads its configuration from an xml file.</li>
							<li>MultiXTpmATL - It is like MultiXTpm only that it is wrapped in an ActiveX Control. This enable running an instance of MultiXTpm in a container application. As an ActiveX Control it exposes some COM interface so it can be activated from some COM or OLE client. MultiXTpmService uses that interface.</li>
							<li>MultiXTpmService - A Windows service that be started and stopped using the service manager. It can be installed multiple times and can run multiple instances of MultiXTpm using a separate configuration file for each instance. It uses MultiXTpmATL to start and stop instances of MultiXTpm.</li>
							<li>gSoapForMultiX - This DLL contains only the default gSoap functions required by some parts of the Application Server. It contains functions like: soap_init, soap_new and so on. It is used when some parts of the Application Server need to initialize a soap structure and there is no other DLL that exports the required functions. MultiXTpm itselft uses gSoap for handling Web Service calls for configuration and control.</li>
							<li>MultiXgSoapSupport - This DLL encapsulates all the functionality of interfacing to the sockets and HTTP. It contains 2 main objects, one that buffers all http data on the input until a full request is received and then it forwards the whole message to the application. It also handles the sending of the response to the client. The other object serializes the SOAP data to and from buffer. MultiXTpm process uses this DLL.</li>
							<li>MultiXTpm Application Wizard - A Visual Studio 2005 Application Wizard, it creates a skeleton application with all the required classes and files in order to start developing a MultiXTpm based application.</li>
							<li>MultiXTpmAdmin - A Visual Studio 2005 Web Application, it used to control and configure MultiXTpm running instances.</li>
						</ul>
