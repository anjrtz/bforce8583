							Configuring MultiXTpm Application Server
						</h2><a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm"
							title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm Application
							Server</a> configuration is stored in an XML text file. When <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm"
								title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm Application Server</a>
						starts, it reads this file, and from that file it builds its processes, links, messages
						and queues tables. Though this file has a well known schema, using a text editor
						to manipulate this file, is not an easy thing to do.<br />
						<br />
						To help in maintaining this
						configuration file, and also to be able to modify the configuration while the system
						is running, <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm"
							title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm Application Server</a>
						was added the capability to receive configuration
						modification commands while running and apply them in real time. This capability
						enables keeping the system running for long periods without the need to restart
						it when applying changes. There are some modifications that cannot be applied immediately,
						and these modifications might require a restart of a specific process or the entire
						system. The system does not
						notify the running processes on real time modification because in most
						cases the applications are written to receive configuration information on startup,
						and a real time reconfiguration might require the application to handle exceptional
						conditions. To simplify things, when such changes in the configuration occur, <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm"
							title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm Application Server</a>
						will forward the new configuration, the next time a new instance of a process is
						started or restarted.<br />
						<br />
						Using <strong>MultiXTpm Administration Server</strong>, a system administrator
						can perform the following actions:<br />
						<ol>
							<li>Add/Delete/Modify Process Class objects with
						all their attributes.<ul>
							<li>Define free format parameters per process class – Name/Value
						pairs.</li>
							<li>Associate Link objects with each process class if needed.</li>
						</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Add/Delete/Modify
						Link objects that can be associated with process classes.</li>
							<li>Add/Delete/Modify Process
						Group objects that are used for message routing.</li>
							<li>Add/Delete/Modify Message objects
						that dictate the rules for routing messages based on their Message Code. </li>

							Controlling MultiXTpm Application Server

						Using <strong>MultiXTpm Administration Server</strong>, an administrator can control
						the runtime environment of <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm" title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">
							MultiXTpm Application Server</a> instance. Once connected to <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm"
								title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm Application Server</a>,
						<strong>MultiXTpm Administration Server</strong> can query <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm"
							title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm Application Server</a>
						for status and statistics of every process that <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm"
							title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm Application Server</a>
						controls. Through this
						status information, the administrator of a system can control each process or group
						of processes by means of Start/Stop/Suspend/Restart/Resume commands. The administrator
						can see in real time the status of each process, including its input queue size,
						the number of concurrent sessions it is handling and the last time it has any activity.

						<strong>MultiXTpm Administration Server</strong> provides a browser based user interface
						that helps configuring all entities in the <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm"
							title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm Application Server</a>
						environment and later forward
						these configurations/modifications to <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm"
							title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm Application Server</a>
						for applying
						and saving. Using <strong>MultiXTpm Administration Server</strong>,
						the administrator
						of the system need not know the actual schema of the configuration file.<br />
						<strong>MultiXTpm Administration Server</strong> is a standalone web application that provides web based user
						interface on one side and it interacts with <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm"
							title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm Application Server</a>
						instance
						on the other side. The interaction with <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm"
							title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm Application Server</a>
						instance is done through <strong>SOAP/XML</strong>
						Web Services interface. This means that <strong>MultiXTpm Administration Server</strong> can communicate with

							MultiXTpm Application Server</a> instance regardless of its location. Both
						applications can communicate with each other using <strong>HTTP</strong> or <strong>HTTPS</strong>.
						The default configuration of <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm" title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">
							MultiXTpm Application Server</a> defines the interface to be <strong>HTTP</strong>.

							Authentication and Authorization</h2>
						<a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm" title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">
							MultiXTpm Application Server</a> can be configured to receive authenticated connections
						or anonymous connections. When using authenticated connections, <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm"
							title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm Application Server</a>
						supports only <strong>HTTP</strong> basic clear text authentication, and this is
						the default configuration of the <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm" title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">
							MultiXTpm Application Server</a>. When using <strong>HTTP</strong> basic authentication, it is advisable
						to configure the connection also as <strong>HTTPS (SSL)</strong> connection, so the clear text password
						used in <strong>HTTP</strong> basic authentication is not revealed. 
						<br />
						<br />
						To be able to receive configuration
						and control commands, <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm"
							title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm Application Server</a>
						was added the capability to authenticate
						the user and to authorize specific users for performing specific tasks. The decision
						on the authentication and the authorization is dictated by the definition of the “<strong>MultiXTpm
							WS Control Link</strong>”.
						If this link is defined for <strong>HTTP</strong> basic authentication, or if <strong>
							HTTP</strong> authentication is <strong>not</strong> defined at all, <strong>HTTP</strong>
						basic authentication is used
						and each and every control and configuration action needs not be authenticated and
						authorized.<br />
						When Authentication and Authorization are used, <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm"
							title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm Application
							Server</a>
						performs the following actions for each request it receives:<br />
						<ol>
							<li>Authenticate
						the requesting user to be a valid user in the system where the specific instance
						is running.<ul>
							<li>Under Microsoft Windows operating system, the user name supplied
						can be a name in any valid format (domain\user, user@domain, user).</li>
							<li>Under
						Linux operating system, <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm"
								title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm Application Server</a>
								uses <strong>PAM</strong> to authenticate the user, so any value
						that is acceptable by <strong>PAM</strong> on the specific system, is also acceptable by <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm"
									title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm Application Server</a>.
						For this to work the administrator of the system must add an entry to <strong>/etc/pam.d
						or to /etc/pam.conf</strong> for the service named “<strong>multixtpm</strong>”.
								Without this entry all request
						to <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm"
									title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm Application Server</a>
								will be rejected.</li>
						</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Once authenticated, <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm"
							title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm Application
								Server</a>
						checks a User Permissions file to decide whether the requesting user is authorized
						to perform the specific action. The User Permissions file contains names, and for each name
						it specifies whether the name is allowed to perform the action. The treatment to
						the “UserName” field in the file is handled differently depending on the operating
						system.<ul>
							<li>Under Microsoft Window operating system, it can be a specific user name
						or a group name. If it is a group name, <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm" title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">
									MultiXTpm Application Server</a> checks if the requesting user
						is a member of that group, and if so, the rules for that group apply. For example
						if the entry specifies “administrators”, any user that is a member of the “administrators”
						group can perform the actions allowed for “administrators” entry.</li>
							<li>Under Linux
						operating system, the name specified is the actual name of an actual user. This
						means that for every user that needs access to the system, there must be an explicit
						entry in the User Permissions File.</li>
						</ul>
							</li>
							<li>While searching for the relevant entry in
						the Users Permissions file, <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm"
								title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm Application Server</a>
								uses the most permissive entry. This means
						that if a user is a member of more than one group, and one of these groups is allowed
						to perform the action, <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm"
									title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">MultiXTpm Application Server</a>
								will allow the user to perform the action.</li>
							<li>When <a href="MultiXTpm%20Application%20Server.htm" title="Click here for a description of MultiXTpm Application Server">
								MultiXTpm Application Server</a> starts, it looks for the User Permissions file as specified
						in the main configuration file. If it does not find one, it creates a new one with
						the default name of “<strong>UserPermissions.xml</strong>” and this file will have two permissive
						entries for “<strong>administrators</strong>” and for “<strong>root</strong>”.
								This means that with the default configuration,
						Windows administrators and linux root will have full access to the system. </li>
